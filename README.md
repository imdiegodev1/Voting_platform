# Voting_platform

This is a basic Django project to understand and practice:

- Django
- ORM
- HTML
- Bootstrap 5

It is a simple platform where you can give your vote to some questions set by an admin. At the end, you can see the results obtained by the different options.

In programming, it is a very good example to understand how the Django design pattern works, the ORM along with the interaction with the database and the URL management of Django.

An important component that I explored in this project is the concept of "project" and "application" that Django has and the class-based and function-based views. Of the latter, in the polls application you can find an application of both cases.

Besides this, it was a good opportunity to manipulate some HTML and Bootstrap and improve the UI with responsive design. Although it's a few components it's a clean interface and suitable for any browser and screen size. Some images of the UI can be seen below:

I recommend you to use the dependencies that are in the requirements.txt file to run the project on your local machine.
